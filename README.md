Spotify 2.0 with NEXT.JS 12.0

-Middleware
-Spotify API
-Tailwind
-NextAuth
-Recoil


The three parts to this Application :
1. Sidebar - Heroicons from TailwindCSS and the playlists from the Spotify APIs
2. Center
3. Player

The Login Process : NextAuth
When we login with our credentials, Spotify will give us an Access Token which allows us to access all of their features - their playlists, playing the songs
Access token expires every hour
So, Refresh Token helps us get a new Access Token.





Things to learn ( Basic Ones ):
overflow:hidden prevents scrollbars from showing up, even when they're necessary.
